## leaflet-challenge

 Using a data set downloaded from the United States Geological Survey web sight we are able to look at the seven day summary of all earthquakes.
 Using Mapbox, Leaflet, html  and Javascrpt we created a data visualization based on location, magnitude and depth of earthquakes.
 We also created a popup event that lists the place, time, magnitude and depth of event.
 In order to use repo user will need a Mapbox API Key saved as a config.js file.
       API_KEY = "key goes here"
